This repo stores my notes from taking [The Advanced SQL Server Masterclass For Data Analysis](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-server-masterclass-for-data-analysis/) by Travis Cuzick. The course uses SSMS but I decided to try using vscode SQL Server Ext so much of the formatting is accomplished with an extension.
